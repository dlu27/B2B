Hello! My name is Daphne and I am a third year Master's Student in UNLV's Couple and Family Therapy program. 
I will be graduating this December 2025 and can't wait to begin my career as a therapist! </p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: large; text-align: left;">
My involvement at UNLV has included being a mentor for both my graduate program and the Grad Rebel Advantage Program.
I have been an Instructional Graduate Assistant where I taught CFT 150 Personal Growth and CFT 360 Contemporary Marriages and Families.
Currently, I am a Graduate Assistant for New Student Orientation (we won this year's homecoming parade cart contest!). 
I was also a recipient of the Rebel of the Year award this year!</p>

<p style="font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: large; text-align: left;">
For extracurricular activities, I was Executive Vice President for Delta Kappa Zeta, our Marriage and Family Honor Society, 
and I am a competitor on Rebel DanceSport, UNLV's competitive ballroom and Latin dance team. Outside of school and dance, 
I have many hobbies including photography, Brazilian jiu jitsu, 
crafting, doing escape rooms, playing board games, watching anime and theatre, reading, 
cuddling with my cat named Remy, and being involved at my church! </p>
